  <strong> Have you been &deg; dragging your feet on the way to class lately?</strong> Do you daydream about rattling off phrases flawlessly 
  in another language, or doing research at a field station deep in the middle of the rainforest? There’s a reason that 
  students who study abroad can’t stop talking about it. Spending time abroad not only fulfills academic goals, but also
   lets you experience a new culture, language, and environment. Nailing down all the details can seem overwhelming, but lucky 
   for you, GoAbroad is here to help! With a directory of over 30,000 study abroad programs and all sorts of helpful tools,
    it’s easy to turn your study abroad dreams into reality.

    Study Abroad Programs give you the opportunity to experience the world as your classroom. Rather than picking things up
     from books and the Internet, navigating a new landscape may open your eyes to culture, history, a new language or your
      heritage. Studying Abroad opens the door to personal growth and discovery too. As you learn to say ‘hello’ in a foreign 
      language, make friends, eat exciting new foods, it is bound to boost your confidence, teach you self-reliance and stretch
       the parameters of your comfort zone

    Intern Abroad - If gaining vital job or business skills is important to you, find International Internships by country and work 
    type.
    
    Volunteer Abroad - Volunteer Abroad in a country that interests you, for the amount of time you have whether a week, a month
     or a year, in the type of volunteer work that would be meaningful to you.
    
     Teach Abroad - Teaching abroad is a wonderful way to learn and educate at the same time. Get specific; search by country,
     duration and even audience.
    
     Intensive Language – If immersing yourself in a foreign language sounds stimulating, search by country, duration and naturally 
    the language you want to learn. Picture yourself studying Italian in Florence Italy as you take sips of your caffe latte?
    
    Full Degree Abroad – If studying overseas appeals to you, but for an extended period, find associates degrees, courses, 
    diplomas, undergraduate and graduate certificates, bachelors, masters and doctorate degrees by country and specialty.
